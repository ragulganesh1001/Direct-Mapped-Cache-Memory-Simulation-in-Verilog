# Direct-Mapped-Cache-Memory-Simulation-in-Verilog
A byte-addressable direct-mapped cache memory system implemented using Verilog. This project includes a complete testbench, waveform simulation, and RTL schematic views generated from Xilinx Vivado. It simulates realistic cache operations such as read hit, read miss, and write-through to main memory.
